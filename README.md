# Strain_Code_fenicsx
The codes includes strain mapping for a semiconductor gate waffere after cool down to near zero kelvin from room temperature. The mapped strain tensor goes as an input to the hamiltonian simulation for quantum dot
qubit for mapping g-tensor. The varying g-tensor due to varying strain allows for  a control knob to acheive qubit gate opeations by changing the gate voltage to shift into different strain locations. 
Initial development of code cotains simple cases to establish its accuracy and correctness and later the actual code will be built.
test.py is the final version of the code. No further developments will be pursured.
